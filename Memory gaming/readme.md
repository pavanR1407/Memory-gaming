## Notes

- The game uses the **Web Audio API**, so sound works only after a **user interaction** (clicking the Start button). This is required by most modern browsers.
- The cards are displayed as **emojis**, but you can customize them in `script.js` under the `allIcons` array.
- The game is fully responsive and adjusts the grid layout based on the number of pairs.
